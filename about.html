        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Patricia Naamala</strong>. I’m passionate about <span class="highlight">Cybersecurity</span> and <span class="highlight">Web Design</span>. I enjoy learning about new technologies, exploring how things work, and building digital experiences that are both beautiful and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I absolutely love <span class="highlight">cozy spaces</span>, rainy days, and the smell of fresh coffee. My idea of the perfect break is curling up with a good book and a steaming cup of coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m always looking to grow and collaborate on exciting projects. Whether it's securing systems or designing modern websites, I’m excited to work with you and bring ideas to life.
